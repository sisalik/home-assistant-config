# home-assistant-config
My Home Assistant configuration files for the fairly modest system I have put together so far.

Features:
- Running on a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B
- 5 wifi-controlled sockets for lights and heating (Sonoff S26 or Basic with the Sonoff-Tasmota firmware)
- DHT22 humidity & temperature sensors and DS18B20 temperature sensors (wired to the Sonoffs or Raspberry Pi)
- Vehicle gate fob connected to Raspberry Pi GPIO via optocouplers (very crudely!)
- Wanhao Duplicator i3 controlled via Octoprint installed on a separate Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+
- Cheap (~Â£30) bullet-style wifi CCTV camera
- Chromecast and Spotify API
